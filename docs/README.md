# Chapman University Software Engineering Code Examples

## Overview
This repository contains code examples to go with Chapman University courses on Software Design and Software Requirements & Testing. It provides practical demonstrations of various software design principles, patterns, and best practices through a commission calculator application.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to:
1. Illustrate software design principles through concrete examples
2. Demonstrate good vs. poor implementation practices
3. Provide a reference for students learning software engineering concepts
4. Support hands-on learning through code exploration and modification

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized around a commission calculator application that demonstrates various software design principles:

- **src/main/java/com/chapman/edu/commissions/model**: Contains the domain model classes for the Sales Commission Management System
- **src/main/java/com/chapman/edu/commissions/principles**: Contains examples of various software design principles
  - Each principle has its own subdirectory with:
    - A README.md explaining the principle
    - An "original" directory with code that violates the principle
    - A "fixed" directory with refactored code that adheres to the principle

## How to Use These Examples

### For Students
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Explore the README.md files in each principle's directory to understand the concept
3. Compare the "original" and "fixed" implementations to see how the principle is applied
4. Run the tests to see how the implementations behave
5. Try modifying the code to further improve it or to experiment with different approaches

### For Instructors
1. Use these examples as supplementary material for lectures
2. Assign exercises where students identify violations of principles in the "original" code
3. Have students implement their own fixes and compare with the provided "fixed" implementations
4. Create assignments where students extend the examples with new features while adhering to the principles

## Learning Path
For those new to software design principles, we recommend studying them in the following order:
1. KISS - Start with simplicity as a foundation
2. DRY - Learn to eliminate duplication
3. OOP - Understand object-oriented fundamentals
4. SOLID - Build on OOP with more advanced principles
5. POLS - Focus on creating intuitive interfaces
6. SOC - Learn to separate different aspects of your program
7. YAGNI - Develop discipline in feature implementation
