# POLS - Principle of Least Surprise

## Overview
The Principle of Least Surprise (POLS), also known as the Principle of Least Astonishment, states that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave, and therefore cause the least confusion or surprise.

## Explanation
The Principle of Least Surprise encourages developers to:

1. Design interfaces that behave in ways that match users' expectations
2. Ensure that methods with similar names behave in similar ways
3. Make sure that methods do what their names suggest they do
4. Avoid hidden side effects that might surprise users of the code
5. Follow established conventions and patterns within the codebase

## Examples in this Directory

This directory contains examples of POLS violations and their fixes:

- **Original**: Contains code examples that violate the Principle of Least Surprise by having methods that don't behave as expected or have surprising side effects.
- **Fixed**: Contains refactored versions of the same code, adhering to the POLS principle by making methods behave in ways that match user expectations.

## Common POLS Violations

1. **Methods That Don't Update State**: Methods that calculate values but don't update related state variables
2. **Unexpected Side Effects**: Methods that perform actions not implied by their names
3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Similar methods that behave differently
4. **Hidden Dependencies**: Code that depends on state that isn't obvious from method signatures
5. **Misleading Method Names**: Methods named in ways that don't accurately reflect their behavior

## Benefits of Following POLS

1. **Reduced Bugs**: Code that behaves as expected is less likely to be misused
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand and modify when it behaves predictably
3. **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can more quickly understand and work with the codebase
4. **Better Collaboration**: Fewer surprises means fewer misunderstandings between team members
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: When APIs behave as expected, they're easier to use correctly
