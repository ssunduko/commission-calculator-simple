# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

This directory contains examples demonstrating the four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1. **Encapsulation** - The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
2. **Inheritance** - The mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
3. **Polymorphism** - The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance or interface implementation.
4. **Abstraction** - The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

## Directory Structure

Each principle has its own subdirectory with examples:

- `/encapsulation` - Examples demonstrating encapsulation
- `/inheritance` - Examples demonstrating inheritance
- `/polymorphism` - Examples demonstrating polymorphism
- `/abstraction` - Examples demonstrating abstraction

## Based on Model Classes

The examples in these directories are based on the model classes in the `com.se310.commissions.model` package, which represent a commission calculation system. The original model classes include:

- `CommissionCalculation`
- `BonusCalculation`
- `AcceleratorCalculation`
- `User`
- `Deal`
- And others

These examples have been simplified and adapted to clearly demonstrate each OOP principle.
