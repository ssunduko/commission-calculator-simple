# Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - Fixed Implementation

## Overview

This package demonstrates a fixed implementation of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), which states that:

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

The original implementation in `com.se310.commissions.solid.original.OCPViolation` violated this principle by using conditional logic (if-else statements) to handle different product types and calculations, requiring modification of existing code to add new product types or calculation methods.

## The Problem

In the original implementation:

1. The `OCPViolation` class used conditional logic (if-else statements) to handle different product types.
2. Adding a new product type required modifying the existing code in multiple methods.
3. The `calculateDiscount`, `calculateCommission`, and `calculateTax` methods all contained similar conditional structures.

This led to:
- Code that was difficult to extend without modification
- Increased risk of introducing bugs when adding new features
- Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (methods doing too much)
- Duplicate conditional logic across multiple methods

## The Solution

The fixed implementation applies the Open/Closed Principle by:

1. Using the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate different algorithms:
   - `DiscountStrategy`: Interface for calculating discounts
   - `CommissionStrategy`: Interface for calculating commissions
   - `TaxStrategy`: Interface for calculating taxes

2. Implementing concrete strategies for each product type and country:
   - Product-specific strategies: `SoftwareDiscountStrategy`, `HardwareDiscountStrategy`, etc.
   - Country-specific strategies: `USTaxStrategy`, `UKTaxStrategy`, etc.

3. Creating calculator classes that use these strategies:
   - `DiscountCalculator`: Uses discount strategies to calculate discounts
   - `CommissionCalculator`: Uses commission strategies to calculate commissions
   - `TaxCalculator`: Uses tax strategies to calculate taxes

4. Making extension easy without modification:
   - New product types can be added by creating new strategy implementations
   - New countries can be added by creating new tax strategy implementations
   - The calculator classes don't need to change when new strategies are added

## Benefits

This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Extensibility**: New product types or countries can be added without modifying existing code.
2. **Maintainability**: Each strategy has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Testability**: Strategies can be tested in isolation, simplifying testing.
4. **Flexibility**: Strategies can be added, removed, or modified at runtime.
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Conditional logic is replaced with polymorphism, reducing code duplication.

## Demonstration

The calculator classes (`DiscountCalculator`, `CommissionCalculator`, `TaxCalculator`) demonstrate how the Open/Closed Principle is applied in this implementation. They use strategies to perform calculations, allowing new strategies to be added without modifying the calculator code.

## Conclusion

By applying the Open/Closed Principle, we've created a more extensible and maintainable design that allows for adding new functionality without modifying existing code. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs and makes the codebase more adaptable to changing requirements.
