# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Fixed Implementation

## Overview

This package demonstrates a fixed implementation of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), which states that:

> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

The original implementation in `com.se310.commissions.solid.original.ISPViolation` violated this principle by defining a large interface with many methods covering different responsibilities. Clients that only needed a subset of these methods were forced to implement all methods, even those they didn't need.

## The Problem

In the original implementation:

1. The `ISPViolation` interface contained methods for commission calculation, deal management, user management, dispute resolution, reporting, and system administration.
2. The `CommissionCalculatorClient` class only needed the commission calculation methods but was forced to implement all other methods, throwing `UnsupportedOperationException` for those it didn't need.

This led to:
- Tight coupling between clients and methods they don't use
- Difficulty in maintaining and extending the code
- Potential for errors when interface methods change

## The Solution

The fixed implementation applies the Interface Segregation Principle by:

1. Breaking down the large interface into smaller, focused interfaces:
   - `CommissionCalculationService`: Methods for calculating and retrieving commissions
   - `DealManagementService`: Methods for managing deals
   - `UserManagementService`: Methods for managing users
   - `DisputeResolutionService`: Methods for handling disputes
   - `ReportingService`: Methods for generating reports
   - `SystemAdministrationService`: Methods for system administration

2. Creating clients that implement only the interfaces they need:
   - `CommissionCalculatorClient`: Implements only the `CommissionCalculationService` interface

## Benefits

This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Reduced Coupling**: Clients depend only on the methods they actually use.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to one interface don't affect clients that don't use it.
3. **Better Testability**: Smaller interfaces are easier to mock and test.
4. **Enhanced Flexibility**: New implementations can be added without affecting existing clients.
5. **Clearer Responsibilities**: Each interface has a clear, focused purpose.

## Demonstration

The `ISPDemo` class demonstrates how the Interface Segregation Principle is applied in this implementation. It shows how clients can use only the interfaces they need without being forced to depend on methods they don't use.

## Conclusion

By applying the Interface Segregation Principle, we've created a more modular, maintainable, and flexible design that allows clients to depend only on the methods they actually use.
