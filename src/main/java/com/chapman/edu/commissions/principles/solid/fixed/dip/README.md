# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - Fixed Implementation

## Overview

This package demonstrates a fixed implementation of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), which states that:

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

The original implementation in `com.se310.commissions.solid.original.DIPViolation` violated this principle by having high-level business logic directly depend on concrete implementations of low-level modules.

## The Problem

In the original implementation:

1. The `DIPViolation` class directly depended on concrete implementations (`MySqlDatabase`, `FileLogger`, `EmailSender`).
2. The high-level business logic was tightly coupled with low-level implementation details.
3. It was difficult to swap out implementations (e.g., changing from MySQL to MongoDB or file logging to cloud logging).

This led to:
- Tight coupling between high-level and low-level modules
- Difficulty in testing due to concrete dependencies
- Reduced flexibility and reusability
- Challenges in maintaining and extending the code

## The Solution

The fixed implementation applies the Dependency Inversion Principle by:

1. Defining abstractions (interfaces) for low-level modules:
   - `Database`: Interface for database operations
   - `Logger`: Interface for logging operations
   - `EmailService`: Interface for email operations

2. Making high-level modules depend on these abstractions:
   - `CommissionService` depends on the interfaces, not concrete implementations

3. Implementing concrete classes that adhere to these interfaces:
   - `MySqlDatabase`: Implements the `Database` interface
   - `FileLogger`: Implements the `Logger` interface
   - `SmtpEmailService`: Implements the `EmailService` interface

4. Using dependency injection to provide the concrete implementations:
   - The `CommissionService` constructor takes interfaces as parameters

## Benefits

This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Decoupling**: High-level modules are decoupled from low-level modules.
2. **Flexibility**: Implementations can be swapped without changing the high-level code.
3. **Testability**: Dependencies can be easily mocked for testing.
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to low-level modules don't affect high-level modules.
5. **Extensibility**: New implementations can be added without modifying existing code.

## Demonstration

The `CommissionService` class demonstrates how the Dependency Inversion Principle is applied in this implementation. It depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, allowing for flexibility and testability.

## Conclusion

By applying the Dependency Inversion Principle, we've created a more flexible, maintainable, and testable design that allows high-level modules to be independent of the low-level module implementations.
