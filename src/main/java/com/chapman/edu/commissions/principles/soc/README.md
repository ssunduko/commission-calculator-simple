# SoC - Separation of Concerns

## Overview
Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle that advocates dividing a computer program into distinct sections, where each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.

## Explanation
The Separation of Concerns principle encourages developers to:

1. Divide a program into distinct features with minimal overlap
2. Organize code into modules or classes that each handle a specific responsibility
3. Reduce coupling between components that handle different concerns
4. Improve maintainability by isolating changes to specific components
5. Enhance testability by allowing components to be tested independently

## Examples in this Directory

This directory contains examples of SoC violations and their fixes:

- **Original**: Contains code examples that violate the Separation of Concerns principle by mixing multiple responsibilities in a single class.
- **Fixed**: Contains refactored versions of the same code, adhering to the SoC principle by separating different concerns into specialized classes.

## Common SoC Violations

1. **God Classes**: Classes that try to do too much and handle multiple responsibilities
2. **Mixed Concerns**: Mixing business logic with presentation, data access, or validation logic
3. **Tangled Dependencies**: Components that are tightly coupled across different concerns
4. **Direct System Interactions**: Business logic directly interacting with external systems or UI
5. **Scattered Logic**: Related functionality spread across multiple components

## Benefits of Following SoC

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to one concern don't affect code for other concerns
2. **Enhanced Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
3. **Better Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
4. **Simplified Development**: Developers can focus on one concern at a time
5. **Easier Collaboration**: Different team members can work on different concerns simultaneously
