# SOLID Principles

## Overview
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental guidelines for good object-oriented design.

## Explanation
The SOLID principles encourage developers to:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - A class should have only one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions

## Examples in this Directory

This directory contains examples of SOLID violations and their fixes:

- **Original**: Contains code examples that violate one or more SOLID principles.
- **Fixed**: Contains refactored versions of the same code, adhering to the SOLID principles.

## Common SOLID Violations

1. **SRP Violations**: Classes that have multiple responsibilities or reasons to change
2. **OCP Violations**: Code that requires modification when new functionality is added
3. **LSP Violations**: Subclasses that don't properly substitute for their parent classes
4. **ISP Violations**: Interfaces that force implementing classes to provide methods they don't need
5. **DIP Violations**: High-level modules directly depending on low-level modules instead of abstractions

## Benefits of Following SOLID

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand, modify, and extend
2. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Well-designed code requires less refactoring in the future
3. **Better Testability**: Code following SOLID principles is typically easier to test
4. **Enhanced Reusability**: Components are more modular and can be reused in different contexts
5. **Increased Flexibility**: Systems can adapt to changing requirements with minimal modifications
