# YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It

## Overview
YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. It is a subset of the Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle.

## Explanation
YAGNI is about avoiding the temptation to write code that you think will be needed in the future but is not needed right now. This principle encourages developers to:

1. Focus on implementing only what is required for the current iteration
2. Avoid speculative coding based on assumptions about future requirements
3. Reduce complexity and maintenance costs
4. Prevent feature creep and over-engineering

## Examples in this Directory

This directory contains examples of YAGNI violations and their fixes:

- **Original**: Contains code examples that violate the YAGNI principle by implementing features that aren't immediately needed.
- **Fixed**: Contains simplified versions of the same code, adhering to the YAGNI principle by including only what's necessary.

## Common YAGNI Violations

1. **Premature Abstraction**: Creating abstract classes or interfaces before they're needed for multiple implementations
2. **Excessive Flexibility**: Adding configuration options or extension points that aren't currently used
3. **Speculative Features**: Implementing functionality based on assumptions about future requirements
4. **Overengineered Data Models**: Adding fields and relationships to data models that aren't needed for current use cases
5. **Unnecessary Methods**: Creating utility methods or helper functions that aren't used in the current implementation

## Benefits of Following YAGNI

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler code is easier to understand, test, and maintain
2. **Faster Development**: Less code means faster implementation and fewer bugs
3. **Better Design**: Focusing on current requirements leads to more focused, cohesive designs
4. **Lower Technical Debt**: Avoiding unnecessary code prevents accumulation of unused or obsolete functionality
5. **More Responsive to Change**: Simpler systems are easier to modify when requirements actually do change
