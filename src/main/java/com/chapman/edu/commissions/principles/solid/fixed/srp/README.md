# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Fixed Implementation

## Overview

This package demonstrates a fixed implementation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that:

> A class should have only one reason to change.

The original implementation in `com.se310.commissions.solid.original.SRPViolation` violated this principle by having a single class handle multiple responsibilities, including commission calculation, data persistence, email notification, logging, and report generation.

## The Problem

In the original implementation:

1. The `SRPViolation` class had multiple responsibilities:
   - Commission calculation
   - Data persistence (database operations)
   - Email notification
   - Logging
   - Report generation

2. This led to a class with multiple reasons to change:
   - Changes to calculation logic
   - Changes to database schema or operations
   - Changes to email format or delivery
   - Changes to logging requirements
   - Changes to report format or content

This resulted in:
- A large, complex class that was difficult to understand and maintain
- High coupling between unrelated functionalities
- Difficulty in testing individual components
- Changes to one aspect affecting unrelated aspects
- Code that was hard to reuse in different contexts

## The Solution

The fixed implementation applies the Single Responsibility Principle by:

1. Separating responsibilities into specialized interfaces:
   - `CommissionCalculator`: Responsible only for calculating commissions
   - `DatabaseService`: Responsible only for data persistence
   - `EmailService`: Responsible only for sending email notifications
   - `ReportGenerator`: Responsible only for generating reports

2. Implementing each interface with a focused class:
   - `CommissionCalculator`: Implements commission calculation logic
   - `DatabaseServiceImpl`: Implements database operations
   - `EmailServiceImpl`: Implements email sending
   - `ReportGeneratorImpl`: Implements report generation

3. Creating a coordinator class that orchestrates the process:
   - `CommissionProcessor`: Coordinates the overall process but delegates specific responsibilities to specialized classes

4. Using dependency injection to provide the specialized classes:
   - The `CommissionProcessor` constructor takes all required dependencies

## Benefits

This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Focused Classes**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect don't affect unrelated aspects.
3. **Better Testability**: Classes can be tested in isolation with mock dependencies.
4. **Enhanced Reusability**: Specialized classes can be reused in different contexts.
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Classes are smaller and easier to understand.

## Demonstration

The `CommissionProcessor` class demonstrates how the Single Responsibility Principle is applied in this implementation. It orchestrates the overall process but delegates specific responsibilities to specialized classes, ensuring that each class has only one reason to change.

## Conclusion

By applying the Single Responsibility Principle, we've created a more maintainable, testable, and flexible design that separates concerns and ensures that each class has only one reason to change. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
